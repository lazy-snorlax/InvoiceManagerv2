# Invoice Manager v2
Create and manage your invoices, generate quotes and keep company/customer contacts on record for your business. 

This is a full rebuild of Invoice Manager using a Laravel API backend, React SPA frontend and SQL Server for database management.

As before, this is based on a legacy MS Access application from 2003, but this version has been modified to be more 'Access' like in its appearance and functionality.

## Build 0.1.0
- React + TailwindCSS
- Laravel API
- Nginx server
- Sql Server Database
- Containerized for local development environment
